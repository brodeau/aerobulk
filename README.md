**AeroBulk** is a FORTRAN90-based library and suite of tools (including a C++ interface) that feature *state of the art* parameterizations to estimate turbulent air-sea fluxes by means of the traditional **aerodynamic bulk formulae**.

These turbulent fluxes, namely, wind stress, evaporation (latent heat flux) and sensible heat flux, are estimated using the sea surface temperature (bulk or skin), and the near-surface atmospheric surface state: wind speed, air temperature and humidity. If the *cool-skin/warm-layer* schemes need to be called to estimate the skin temperature, surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes are required.

# **> Bulk formula and their parameterizations**

**AeroBulk** relies on the following traditional set of bulk formula to estimate turbulent fluxes at the air-sea interface:

$$ \vec{\tau} = \rho\  C_D \  \vec{U}_z  \  U_B $$

$$ E   = \rho \ C_E \     \big[    q_s   - q_z \big]  \  U_B $$

$$ Q_L = -L_v \  E $$

$$ Q_H = \rho \ C_H \ C_P \ \big[ \theta_z - T_s \big] \  U_B  $$

where $\rho$ is the density of air. The $z$ subscript relates to the reference height above the air-sea interface (generally _z=10m_).
$\vec{U}_z$ is the wind speed vector at the reference height.
$U_B$ is the bulk scalar wind speed at the reference height (very close to $|\vec{U}_z|$ in most cases).
$\theta_z$ and $q_z$ are the potential temperature and specific humidity of air at the reference height, respectively.
$T_s$ and $q_s$ are the absolute (= potential) temperature and specific humidity of air immediately at the air-sea interface (_z=0_), respectively; if the _cool-skin/warm-layer_ scheme is used, these two are deduced from the skin temperature, otherwise they are deduced from the bulk SST (default).

Any decent level of accuracy from this set of formula can only be achieved through the "best possible" estimate of the 3 bulk transfer coefficient $C_D$, $C_E$, and $C_H$ (drag, evaporation, and sensible heat coefficients).
In **AeroBulk**, these bulk coefficients can be estimated thanks to a collection of _bulk parameterizations_ a.k.a _bulk algorithms_, which "attempt" to relate the value of these coefficients to the near-surface atmospheric stability, the wind speed, and (ideally) the roughness of the sea surface.






The following figure provides a schematic overview on the way turbulent fluxes are computed in AeroBulk:

&nbsp;

Currently, in AeroBulk, 5 bulk parameterizations are available to compute $C_D$, $C_E$, and $C_H$ used in the bulk formula:

*   COARE v3.0 ([Fairall *et al.*, 2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016<0571:BPOASF>2.0.CO;2))
*   COARE v3.6 ([Edson *et al.*, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-12-0173.1) + Chris Fairall, *private communication*, 2016)
*   ECMWF ([IFS (Cy40) documentation](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/IFS/CY40R1+Official+IFS+Documentation))
*   ANDREAS ([Andreas *et al.*, 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.2424))
*   NCAR (Large & Yeager 2004, [2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-008-0441-3))

In the COARE and ECMWF algorithms, a cool-skin/warm layer scheme is included and can be activated if the input sea-surface temperature to be used is the bulk SST (usually measured a few tenths of meters below the surface). Activation of these cool-skin/warm layer schemes requires the surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative flux components to be provided. Other parameterizations, such as NCAR, are meant to be used with the bulk SST, and do not feature a cool-skin/warm layer scheme.

Beside bulk algorithms, AeroBulk also provides a collection of functions (module `mod_phymbl.f90`) to accurately estimate relevant atmospheric parameters such as: density of air, different expressions of the humidity of air, viscosity of air, specific humidity at saturation, *Obukhov* length, bulk *Richardson* number, wind gustiness, etc...

The focus in AeroBulk is readability, efficiency, and portability towards modern ocean & atmosphere GCMs (Fortran 90, set of modules and a library).

# **> Compilation of AeroBulk**

Normally, AeroBulk should compile fine with GNU `gfortran` (version 7 and above) and Intel `ifort`.
Prior to typing `make`, make sure that a file or symbolic link named `make.macro`, which contains architecture specific compilation paths and options, is present in the root directory of AeroBulk. Template examples for `make.macro` can be found in the `arch/` directory.

Compile the library and basic executables:

```make```

Compile the suite of test / diagnostic executables:

```make test```

Compile the C++ interface:

```make cpp```


## Using aerobulk routines and functions in your GCM

#### GCMs written in Fortran

*Include* compilation flag for the compiler to locate the `*.mod` module files:

```$(FC) $(FFLAGS) -I<path_to_aerobulk>/mod ...```

Linking to AeroBulk's library:

```... -L<path_to_aerobulk>/lib -laerobulk```

#### GCMs written in C++

*Include* compilation flag for the compiler to locate the `*.hpp` header file:

```$(CXX) $(CXXLAGS) -I<path_to_aerobulk>/include ...```

Linking to AeroBulk's library:

```... -L<path_to_aerobulk>/lib -laerobulk_cxx -laerobulk```



&nbsp;

# **> Giving AeroBulk a first try in interactive "toy mode"**

Check that `bin/aerobulk_toy.x` has been compiled and execute it:

     ./bin/aerobulk_toy.x

You will be interactively prompted for different sea-surface and ABL related parameters, such as SST, air temperature and humidity, wind speed, etc.  Then `aerobulk_toy.x` will compute all the turbulent air-sea fluxes with all the algorithms available (as well as third-party diagnostics of the ABL), and will print it in the form of a summary table.

 List of command line options for `aerobulk_toy.x`:

    -p   => Ask for sea-level pressure, otherwise assume 1010 hPa
    
    -r   => Ask for relative humidity rather than specific humidity
    
    -S   => Use the Cool Skin Warm Layer parameterization to compute
            and use the skin temperature instead of the bulk SST
            only in COARE and ECMWF
    
    -N   => Force neutral stability in surface atmospheric layer
            -> will not ask for air temp. at zt, instead will only
            ask for relative humidity at zt and will force the air
            temperature at zt that yields a neutral-stability!
    
    -h   => Show this message


Example of an output obtained with the following setup:

 * _z<sub>u_ = 10 m
 * _z<sub>t_ = 2 m
 * _SST_ = 22&deg;C
 * _t<sub>zt_ = 20&deg;C
 * _q<sub>zt_ = 12 g/kg
 * _U<sub>zu_ = 5 m/s

<!-- $$  SST = 22^{\circ}C \\ \theta_z = 20^{\circ}C $$ -->

# **> Computing turbulent fluxes with AeroBulk**

AeroBulk can also directly compute the 3 turbulent fluxes by means of the `aerobulk_model()` routine of module `mod_aerobulk` (`mod_aerobulk.f90`):

           CALL AEROBULK_MODEL( jt, Nt, calgo, zt, zu, sst, t_zt, hum_zt, U_zu, V_zu, SLP, &
           &                    Qe, Qh, Tau_x, Tau_y, Evap                                 &
           &                   [, Niter=N, rad_sw=Rsw, rad_lw=Rlw] )

&nbsp;

# **> Computing transfer coefficients with AeroBulk**

In AeroBulk, 5 different routines are available to compute the bulk transfer (_a.k.a_ exchange) coefficients C<sub>D</sub>, C<sub>H</sub> and C<sub>E</sub>. Beside computing the transfer coefficients, these routines adjust air potential temperature and specific humidity from height _z<sub>t</sub>_ to the reference height (wind) _z<sub>u</sub>_. They also return the bulk wind speed, which is the scalar wind speed at height _z<sub>u</sub>_ with the potential inclusion of a gustiness contribution (in calm and unstable conditions).


**> TURB_COARE3p0, transfer coefficients with COARE 3.0 (replace "3p0" by "3p6" to use COARE 3.6)**

Use `turb_coare3p0()` of module `mod_blk_coare3p0` (`mod_blk_coare3p0.f90`).

**> Some Examples**

Using COARE 3.6 without the use of the cool-skin & warm-layer schemes, with air temperature and humidity provided at 2m and wind at 10m:

    PROGRAM TEST_COEFF
        USE mod_const
        USE mod_aerobulk, ONLY: AEROBULK_INIT, AEROBULK_BYE
        USE mod_blk_coare3p0
        ...
        !! Initialization and sanity check:
        CALL AEROBULK_INIT( Nt, 'coare3p6', Ts, t2, q2, U10, V10, P0,  l_cswl=.FALSE. )
        ...
        DO jt = 1, Nt
            ...
            qs = 0.98 * q_sat( Ts, P0 ) ! spec. hum. of saturation at the air-sea interface (z=0) [kg/kg]
            ...
            CALL TURB_COARE3P6( jt, 2., 10., Ts, t2, qs, q2, SQRT(U10*U10+V10*V10), .false., .false., &
            &                   Cd, Ch, Ce, t10, q10, U_blk )
            ...
        END DO
        ...
    END PROGRAM TEST_COEFF

In this case, `Ts` and `qs`, the surface temperature and saturation specific humidity won't be modified. The actual value of `qs` must be provided as an input.

Now the same but using the cool-skin & warm-layer schemes:

    PROGRAM TEST_COEFF
        USE mod_const
        USE mod_aerobulk, ONLY: AEROBULK_INIT, AEROBULK_BYE
        USE mod_blk_coare3p0
        ...
        !! Initialization and sanity check:
        CALL AEROBULK_INIT( Nt, 'coare3p6', Ts, t2, q2, U10, V10, P0,  l_cswl=.TRUE. )
        ...
        DO jt = 1, Nt
            ...
            CALL TURB_COARE3P6( jt, 2., 10., Ts, t2, qs, q2, SQRT(U10*U10+V10*V10), .true., .true., &
            &                   Cd, Ch, Ce, t10, q10, U_blk,                       &
            &                   Qsw=Rsw, rad_lw=Rlw, slp=P0,                       &
            &                   isecday_utc=50400, plong=xlongitudes )
            ...
        END DO
        ...
    END PROGRAM TEST_COEFF

We provide arrays of the NET solar flux to the ocean (`Rsw`), downwelling longwave (infrared) flux (`Rlw`), sea-level atmospheric pressure (`P0`), and longitudes (`xlongitudes`); as well as the current UTC time as seconds since 00:00 (here 2PM = 50400).
Note: `Ts` is the bulk SST as an input and is updated to the skin temperature as an output! Value passed to `qs` as an input won't be used, however, as an output, `qs` is the saturation specific humidity at temperature `Ts`!

# **> Computing atmospheric state variables with AeroBulk**

A selection of useful functions to estimate some atmospheric state variables in the marine boundary layer are available in the module `mod_phymbl` (`mod_phymbl.f90`).

Example for computing SSQ of Eq.(1) out of the SST and the SLP:

    PROGRAM TEST_PHYMBL
        USE mod_const
        USE mod_phymbl
        ...

        SSQ(:,:) = 0.98*q_sat(SST, SLP)
        ...
    END PROGRAM TEST_PHYMBL
